### Project Overview: Industrial Submersible Pump Impeller Defect Detection

This project focuses on developing a CNN-based model for detecting defects in industrial submersible pump impellers, which are critical components in machinery used for pumping fluids. Early detection of defects in these impellers is crucial to maintaining the efficiency of the pump system, avoiding unexpected breakdowns, and minimizing downtime in industrial operations.

The model will classify impeller conditions as either defective or non-defective by analyzing image data or vibration signal data that has been transformed into images (such as spectrograms). Vibration signals can provide valuable insights into the operational state of the impellers, with abnormal signals often indicating potential defects.

**Key steps in the project include:**

**Data Collection:** Gather labeled image data or vibration signals transformed into spectrograms.

**Data Preprocessing:** Process and prepare the data for training, including any necessary transformations and augmentations.

**Model Development:** Design and implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can effectively extract features from the input data and classify impellers as defective or non-defective.

**Training and Evaluation:** Train the model on the labeled data and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


The goal is to provide a reliable, automated system for monitoring the health of pump impellers, helping industries reduce maintenance costs and prevent catastrophic failures through early detection.
